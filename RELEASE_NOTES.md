# MemoryLane v1.5.9

Task mining waits for a connection instead of failing days while offline.

## What's Changed

- **No connection, no mining**: before claiming a day, scheduled sweeps check that the provider's host resolves. A laptop that wakes before Wi-Fi reconnects no longer spends attempts. Local models still mine offline (#286).

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Postal addresses are not scrubbed — no reliable pattern separates them from ordinary navigation paths and page text.
- Vertex managed-mode bearer tokens aren't refreshed in-flight — long-running operations that outlive the token TTL may see 401s until the next refresh cycle (DEU-84).
- Windows OCR still depends on native OCR component availability.
- Intel macOS is not yet officially supported.

## Installation

- macOS customer (Apple Silicon): install from the GitHub release page.
